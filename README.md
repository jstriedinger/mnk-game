# m,n,k-game
As part of other recruitment proccess I had to create a C/C++ m,n,k game. Since I do not currently had any C/C++ project in my portfolio I think is a good idea to share this little project to showcase just that: C/C++ skills.

## Description
This project is made with the rule of using only the standard library, which is why I didn't use somethng like getch from the conio header to get "backspace" key presses because is not part of the standard library.
Functionalities:
- Varible m,n,k-game that works with any number of rows, columns  and stones (number of consecutives to win)
- Players can backtrack by typing "undo". It backtrack thanks to a stack of moves
- The code checks for horizontal, vertical and diagonal matches
