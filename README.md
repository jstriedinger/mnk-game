# m,n,k-game
As part of other recruitment assignments I've had to create something like this. Since I didn't much C/C++ project on my portafolio, I think is a good idea to add something like this to my gitub!

## Description
This project is made with the rule of using only the standard library, which is why I didn't use somethng like getch from the conio header to get "backspace" key presses because is not part of the standard library.
Functionalities:
- Varible m,n,k-game that works with any number of rows, columns  and stones (number of consecutives to win)
- Players can backtrack by typing "undo". It backtrack thanks to a stack of moves
- The code checks for horizontal, vertical and diagonal matches
